# Theme Park Website Project

## Event Horizon Park

Event Horizon Park was born out of an idea to create an amuzement park dedicated to the wonders of space and beyond

In late 2022, we decided to make our dreams into a reality when our plans were greenlit and construction began for our park

By late 2023, our vision was complete and so opened EVENT HORIZON PARK, a place where families can go on astronomical adventures while learning all about the enigmas of Outerspace

So, what are you waiting for?

Book your tickets today and reach for the stars!


## 1. About the Website
This website is dedicated to an imaginary theme park with a space adventure theme. It includes three main pages:

- Index Page: Provides information about events, a map, address, schedule, and a brief overview of the site.
- Park Information Page: Details about the park, including rides, shops, and food options.
- Tickets Page: Information about ticket pricing and purchasing options.

## 2. Technology Used
The website primarily uses HTML and CSS, with some JavaScript for additional functionality:

- HTML and CSS: Used for the basic structure and styling of the website.
- JavaScript: Added for interactive features such as:
    - Carousel effects
    - Image map tooltips on the Park Information page
    - Expanding Q&A fields used throughout the site
- External Libraries: We incorporated external libraries like Bootstrap and jQuery to enhance design and functionality.


## 3. Work Allocation
- Allysha: Led the design and artistic aspects of the website.
- Vijay, Jeff, Bruce: Contributed to the coding and implementation of the website features.


## 4. Achievements
Through this project, we had the opportunity to:

- Learn and apply HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript skills.
- Enhance our understanding of web development practices.
- Gain practical experience with external libraries like Bootstrap and jQuery.

Our team collaboration helped solidify our knowledge and improve our web development skills.


# Points of interest

- We integrated the Bootstrap JS library to implement an Image Carousel effect, going beyond basic HTML and CSS. This allowed us to learn and apply JavaScript effectively.

    (We understand using JS does not count, but it was beneficial for us to learn it.)

- We used/referenced the JavsScript effect to display tooltips at specific pixel locations on an image, enhancing user interaction.

- Our theme of a space exploration  theme park involved detailed discussion to create a realistic and engaging story and park features.

- We utilized a wide range of CSS effects covered in the course, ensuing a comprehensive application of our learning.

- Team member Allysha did original artworks, and Vijay used Chat Gpt for generating various park images.

- We managed our work by using [Github](https://github.com/lockelost/Uol_CM1040_team26)
